        <p>다만 세미콜론이 항상 입력 되는것은 아니에요.<br>
        세미콜론을 붙이지 않는것이 편할지라도 가끔 Javascript가 자동으로 세미콜론을 붙이지 않는 경우가 있어요.<br>
        이때문에 줄바꿈으로 구문을 나눴더라도, 세미콜론을 붙여주는것이 좋아요.</p>

        <h3>주석</h3>
        <p>Javascript를 입력하다보면 코드가 더욱더 복잡해져 뭐가 뭔지 알기 어려워져요. 이때 주석(Comment)을 통해 코드에 설명을 붙일 수 있어요.</p>
        <p>주석을 입력하게 되면 Javascript는 주석을 무시하게되요. 덕분에 설명을 붙여도 에러가 나지 않게되요.</p>
        <p>주석에는 2가지 종류가 있어요. 한 줄짜리 주석은 <code class="language-html">//</code> 로 시작해요</p>
